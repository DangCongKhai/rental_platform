# WF-11 Correct unconfirmed proposal

Actors: Owner

Requirements: FR71 FR82

## Preconditions and trigger
Unconfirmed segment; original awaiting revision or pending renewal. Trigger is the named user action or due system evaluation.

## Main flow
1. Keep old row/document/decision.
2. Create new tenancy_contracts row, increment version_number and set predecessor.
3. Recheck/reacquire dates; owner explicitly acknowledges new row; new deadline/pointer.
4. Invite tenant to independently acknowledge new version.

## Alternative and failure flows
- Another booking may take released dates; conflict must not allocate.
- Already mutually confirmed terms cannot be edited/corrected in-place.

## Postcondition
New immutable proposal; previous confirmations do not transfer.

## Consistency boundary
Use current revisions/Policies and the shared actions; state-changing flows capture audit/outbox/replay where required. A read/favourite is never an allocation authority.
