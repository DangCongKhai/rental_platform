# WF-13 Propose renewal contract segment

Actors: Owner

Requirements: FR70 FR84

## Preconditions and trigger
Pending renewal request and compatible future dates. Trigger is the named user action or due system evaluation.

## Main flow
1. Begin segment at confirmed_end+1day; enter negotiated terms/document.
2. Add RENEWAL under same tenancy, basis contract and renewal request.
3. Owner confirms row; expand blocked end only, retain confirmed end and pending request.
4. Run exact-contract confirmation workflow; only final agreement accepts renewal.

## Alternative and failure flows
- Existing future tenancy overlap fails expansion.
- Decline/expiry restores confirmed span and retains request pending; old rent stays current until new segment starts.

## Postcondition
Continuous tenancy with immutable original/renewal history.

## Consistency boundary
Use current revisions/Policies and the shared actions; state-changing flows capture audit/outbox/replay where required. A read/favourite is never an allocation authority.
